#### Instructions for hosting your own Script Center Scripts in your own repo

1) Go to your 'own' MSDN profile e.g. https://social.technet.microsoft.com/profile/ben%20wilkinson i.e. replace with your own link.
1) Log in
1) Click on the Privacy Tab
1) Click on the "CREATE" button next to "Collect your data from MSDN Code Gallery, TechNet Code Gallery all together"
1) Once it completes Donwload your ZIP of your scripts and extract it.
1) Clone this repo https://github.com/brwilkinson/msdn-scriptcenter-repo
1) Place all of the Script Directories (from the scritp extract) into the project "artifacts" directory. E.g. each in it's own folder
1) Copy the metadata file from your download and copy it over the top of the _data\scripts.json file.
    1) For now we are only using the "userProject" array from that file, you can choose to delete the rest of the objects, if you like.
1) Execute the script in the scripts directory scripts\add-script-metadata.ps1
    1) This will recurse through all of the directories under artifacts and find only those with a nested ps1 file
    1) It will update the metadata in the data File to include the script path used to link to your scripts in github
1) Update the _config.yml file with your GitHub Repo
    1) The "sourcebaseurl" that points to which ever branch you are using for your scripts
    1) The "url" which is the GitHubs Pages URL of your repo
    1) Other contact info on that page, for your GitHub pages website.
1) Enable "Pages" on the repo on GitHub settings: e.g. https://guides.github.com/features/pages/
1) Push the changes and test.
